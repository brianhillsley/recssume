# recssume

The main way people format their resumes is through Microsoft Word or the Adobe suite, both of which cost money and require time to learn the tricks of using their software for formatting. Microsoft Word has given me many headaches over formatting tables for my resume, and for that reason, I want there to be a CSS/HTML resume template.

Currently the project only consists of a demonstration (my resume as of December 6th, 2016) and the goal would be to get a generic format that is easy for anyone with the CSS/HTML know-how to make a gorgeous but flexible resume.

To browse the demonstration, make sure you have both the css and html file in the same directory, then simply view the html file in a web browser. 

Contributions to this effort would be awesome! So feel free.
